# Movie-Matcher
## CS 252 HTML Web App Project
A web application that allows users to add movies they have seen into a list on their user profile and subsequently rate that movie from a scale of 1 to 10. Based on the genre, rating, and director of the movie, users can connect with each other and chat about opinions and details of their favorite movies.
